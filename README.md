# Namedict

Before you use this utility, please try to answer the three questions below.  If all answers are "Yes", just go ahead.

1. 您是中国人吗? ( If you don't understand it at all, I'm sure that you don't need it :)  Cuz it means "r u Chinese?")
2. 您即将或打算拥有一个孩子吗? (Wiil your child come into the world soon, or if you plan to have one?)
3. 您的孩子是否会经常处于一个和国际社会打交道的环境? (Will your child communicate with foreigners very often?)

Congratulations, Mr. Yes!  I think this tool will meet your requirements and helps you give your child an Easy-to-Read Chinese name.  That's the initial idea, just to make it pronounceable for foreigners, and provide a consistent pronunciation in Chinese and other languages.  It's not trying to catch up with the international trend.

## Examples

Here are a couple of typical Chinese names which could twist foreigners' tongue:

* 晓岚 xiaolan  -  "x" in Deutsch is pronounced as "ks"
*   科 ke       -  "ke" actually sounds like "key" in English
*   乖 guai     -  "guai" will be divided into three parts, finally it's "gu" + "a" + "yi"

## Exceptions

Everything in the world has an exception, so does the pronunciation of Chinese names.

* As mentioned above, "te" has a different pronunciation in English, just like the word "tea".  However, if you add another Chinese Pinyin behind, e.g. "teran", then "te" performs the same pronunciation as in Chinese, no more like "tea".
